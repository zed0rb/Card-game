# Card-game
War (also known as Battle in the United Kingdom) is a simple card game, typically played by two players using a standard playing card deck.
The deck is divided evenly among the players, giving each a down stack. In unison, each player reveals the top card of their deckâ€”this is a "battle".
If the two cards played are of equal value, then there is a "war".Both players place the next card of their pile face down (some variants have three face down cards) and then another card face-up. The owner of the higher face-up card wins the war and adds all the cards on the table to the bottom of their deck.

Those who collect the 52 cards at first is declared as the winner.

## In this project players should see:
  Player name\
